His communication was very good, he met all deadlines, and his skills were reasonably strong. He've been working with me for over a year and he did an awesome work even that the milestones were constantly changing and some tasks were not clear enough. I had to pause the project for other reasons.I enjoyed working with Sherwin and will likely have additional jobs for him in the future.</h5>
